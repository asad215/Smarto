Chatbot Widget Instructions
=============================

1. Upload all files (widget.html, index.html) to your website or hosting platform.

2. widget.html is the chatbot interface. It connects to your backend:
   https://james-chatbot-2.onrender.com/chat

3. index.html is a sample page that auto-opens the chat widget in an iframe when the page loads.

4. To embed the widget on any site, include an iframe pointing to widget.html:
   <iframe src="widget.html" width="350" height="450" style="border:none;"></iframe>

5. You can customize styles, positions, and behavior as needed in the HTML/CSS.
